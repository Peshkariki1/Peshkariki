3. Run command ```npm ci``` in terminal VScode.

4. After, execute ```npx cypress open```  to run tests.

**Project Coding Convention**

Naming conventions:
We shall use Camelcase for naming conventions: ```camelCase```

**Spec structure:**

- Each block ```describe``` should contain name of group
- Each test (```it```) should contain name of test case (```AT```) 
example:

describe('Create Order', () => {

    it('AT_001.001 | should display create order container', function () {
        ...
    })

    it('AT_002.001 |  Check the maximum allowed input value for the userPhone field should not exceed 256 characters', function () {
        ...
    })
})

**Attention!**

Not allowed to install any libraries, plugins, etc. to avoid changing configuration files. 
The cypress.env.json created automatically when the ci/cd is started

**!!Do not push changed files as:**

```package.json```
```package.lock.json```
```ci.yml```
```cancel.yml```
```cypress.config.js```
```e2e.js```
